# Form Wave Animation

https://thedanitor.github.io/form_wave_animation/

This project is from the Day 8 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have heavily commented the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what each line of code does.

### Overall Impression

Really cool form animation! Learning how to use JS to create inline style formulas (especially for delay and other timing) will be very helpful in the future.

### Things Learned

* Transparent is a color
* inline-block acts like an inline element, but allows height, width, margins, padding to be set
* cubic-bezier can be used to create transition with variable speed https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/func_cubic-bezier.asp
* Can use JS to create formulas for inline styles
